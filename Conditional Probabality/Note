Conditional probability P(A | B) indicates 
the probability of event "A" happening given that event B happened.

    P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
We can easily understand the above formula using the below diagram. 
Since B has already happened, the sample space reduces to B. 
So the probability of A happening becomes P(A ∩ B) divided by P(B)



Example:
In a batch, there are 80 % C programmers, and 40% are Java and C programmers. What is the probability that a C programmer is also Java programmer?

Let A --> Event that a student is Java programmer
    B --> Event that a student is C programmer
    P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)
           = (0.4) / (0.8)
           = 0.5
So there are 50 % chances that student that knows C also knows Java 


Product Rule:
Derived from above definition of conditional probability by multiplying both sides with P(B)


   P(A ∩ B) = P(B) * P(A|B) 


Understanding Conditional probability through tree:
Computation for Conditional Probability can be done using tree, This method is very handy as well as fast when for many problems.

Example: In a certain library, twenty percent of the fiction books are worn and need replacement. 
Ten percent of the non-fiction books are worn and need replacement. 
Forty percent of the library's books are fiction and sixty percent are non-fiction. 

What is the probability that a book chosen at random are worn? Draw a tree diagram representing 
the data.

Solution: 

Let F represents fiction books and N represents non-fiction books. 
Let W represents worn books and G represents non-worn books.



P(worn)= P(N)*P(W | N) + P(F)*P(W | F)
              
           = 0.6*0.1  +  0.4* 0.2      
           = 0.14
